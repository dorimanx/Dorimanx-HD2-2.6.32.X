 * Bad-block-relocation (BBR) target for device-mapper.
 *
 * The BBR target is designed to remap I/O write failures to another safe
 * location on disk. Note that most disk drives have BBR built into them,
 * this means that our software BBR will be only activated when all hardware
 * BBR replacement sectors have been used.
