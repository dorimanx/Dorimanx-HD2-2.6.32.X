New Kernel 5.7 ULTRA ICS+CM7

*Added tons of code for SWAP and ZRAM! now we get lots of free RAM!
Swap will be auto refreshed and reduced, and free ram will grow back to to max possible or balance with swap use!

*Added more fixed and tuned BUSYBOX! now it's 1.9MB (check that you have free space on system before update.! at least 5mb free! (just in case) )

*Added new CPU cache instructions for better cache processing (RAM cache not disk cache)

*I have added new WIFI driver from CM7 kernel, now CH13/14 works!
Tuned the wifi driver, added new code for ROAMING and for wake locks add/remove in need.
Also reduced the voltage that wifi use from 2750mv to 2050mv!
lots of power will be saved!

*I have added lots of code to video drivers from CM7 kernel!

*Added Power Manager full code for longer standby and deep sleep, and wake locks remove.

*Added more tweaks for hyper and ondemand, now we have to most advanced GOVS! even in kernel 3.2.0 they dont have it!
It's is was HUGE code change! see my GIT (ics branch!)

New Kernel 5.6 ULTRA ICS+CM7

I have worked on this one, countless hours!!! (i have reuploaded kernel now! i know i have uploaded it before, but now it's done!)

*I have cleaned and readded the RCU TINY CPU addon, it's was damaged and not adapted for 2.6.32, now it's is and in V8 was V3!
This boost the cpu and keep the stability at max.

*Removed the lagfree gov. it's not tuned and bad for use, instead i have boosted the hyper and ondemand even more!

*Added new ADB driver from 2.3.37 kernel. all cool and one less warning in kernel build.

*Reverted shared memory driver, i have found some bug and i hope it's will fix some problems.

*I have found out that if i use 2 zram drives each 150MB then system is more stable that way and working better, the first zram filled, then the second filled.
and the process working faster with less ram drive!
So now it's load balanced! they will work together to give us 300 more ram!

*Added to install menu some good stuff!
1)you can now install the non CM7 ZRAM from menu.
2)you can now activated the keys light on/off by light, mod!
3)you can choose languages and theme!
4)you can install most advanced busybox 1.19.4 FULL! all included! 1.763MB! not some 400kb
Updated and Compiled by me
5)you can safely reboot after all installed.

Important message for CM7 and My ROM users!

Update the BUSYBOX!
Update the ZRAM for CM7

Important message for NON CM7 ROM users!

Update the ZRAM for NON CM7
Update the BUSYBOX but remember to backup yours first, just in case!

Have fun and report.

for BETA team i cooked some test kernel i will upload it also in time..
Still some stuff to do.

New Kernel 5.3 ULTIMATE ICS
*Retuned the settings to stop the black screen after wakeup.

I am pausing my development for now, i need to focus on things and fix the bugs off line.

*Fixed the Native USB tether!
*Added lots of Advanced Network futures!
I hope it's will reduce the net bugs or clear them!
*Tuned some code.
*Removed unused governors, less resource spent.

kernel development is really pain in #@@, and bugs are jump on us every time!
But if i can find them and remove them, then we are closer to perfect kernel!

So keep the reports flow!

    Thanks to Marc1706 and to bananacakes!!! (Kernel Mega DEV)

    *Added lots of updates from HERE and lots but not all from HERE
    *kernel merged with 2.6.35.x [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG]

    *Added major fix for Dynamic Voltage MOD in kernel. now it's finally works
    *Upgraded regulator core from Kernel 2.5.35.14 to be able to fix the AVS
    as should! the 15voltage script is back to init.d!
    But this time it's can control the dynamic voltage settings!

    example:
    echo "499200 1000 1075" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/vdd_levels_havs
    echo "537600 1000 1100" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/vdd_levels_havs
    echo "576000 1000 1100" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/vdd_levels_havs

    frequency min voltage max voltage > sent to sysfs interface.
    new 15voltage will check if your kernel support vdd_levels_havs if yes activate dynamic settings if no activate static! [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG]

    Fix was been made by Marc the great kernel DEV from .35 kernel.

    *Added fix for auto button on in dark and off in light, now we can switch to old ways, 10 sec on then off till touched, or screen off/on this is the default in ROM if you need to have auto light on /off depend on light, edit the 13_modules script in init.d and look for #KEYBOARDAUTOLIGHTON

    Remove the # save (remove the .bkp) and reboot or run this for imitate effect.
    echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/btn_backlight_manager/button_auto
    but it will be cleared on next boot, so 13_modules script change is needed.

    Fix was been made by Great Kernel Dev Munjeni by my request for you all [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG]

    *Added new Governor ondemanx it's more battery friendly but not super fast as original tweaked ondemand, best to use it on screen off!
    *Added Vdd AVS ( Adaptive Voltage Scaling ) code files! (by Marc1706)
    *Tweaked AVS code for HTC Leo (by Marc1706)
    *Raise VOLTAGE_MIN_START of AVS to 950 (by Marc1706)
    *Use a realtime priority thread for AVS. (by Marc1706)
    *Tweaked the AVS to support 1.61Ghz and tweaked Voltage ranges to prevent SOD and over drain. (By dorimanx)
    *Tweak camera (better picks in dark, less greeny) (by Marc1706)
    *Added Light Sensos Fix (By Munjeni)
    *Added Keyboard backligh !ON! in DARK, and !OFF! in LIGHT [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG](can be tweaked in ROM) (By Munjeni)
    *Tweaked Settings and removed all king of stuff that not needed for normal operations. (By dorimanx)
    *Added the Colored ADB in initrd.gz, but it's working only in LINUX or in SSH session! not via windows ADB!
    Just type logcat -C
    And see nice colurs!
    *Tweaked kernel to reduce battery drain (removed not needed stuff that sit and eat battery [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG])
    *Added updated interactiveX governor (by Marc1706)
    *Added new Governors to play with: Lagfree, SavagedZen, scary, superbad, virtuous. (by Marc1706)
    *Changed zram manual activation script to 375MB to reduce the cpu load.
    *Reduced zram also in auto script to max of 375MB

    *Tweaked the Deadline Scheduler to boost read/write i/o speed.
    By request from NuttShell I have added to kernel Step that will allow installing custom mic gain file for MIUI ROM and initd.

    Change log only for MIUI:
    ***Added miui inird.gz
    ***Added changed mic gain script
    ***Added custom miui rom default.acdb and htcleo.acdc to reduce calls problems.
    ***Added my tweaked modules script.

    All thanks to NuttShell for supplying files for MIUI rom.
    *I have added new NAND driver, + Network, CPU, and system patch by Munjeni Thanks allot for your hard work, and for looking for a way to mount EXT4 on NAND!

    *I have patched from 2.6.32.39 to 2.6.32.50 main line!
    *Added 6 disk schedulers deadline as default (AS,CFQ,SIO,DEADLINE,VR)
    *Tweaked max cpu voltage from 1350 to 1375
    *Added max CPU freq to 1.6 with 1375 voltage
    *Fixed the CPU settings, so 998000 is really 1Ghz and 1.61 is MAX overclock! It.s slightly faster than Tytung 1.19Ghz because of more voltage!
    So to get non overclocked device use 998000 this is also the default!
    *Added minor stable tweaks for best kernel support and faster ROM!
    see /system/etc/init.d/13_modules (my ROM users have them all in 2.9.9 ROM)

    Patch to .50 was from HERE
    And patch from .15 to .49 from HERE

    *Patched Kernel from 2.6.32.15 to 2.6.32.39!

    *Added new SQLB allocator, Thanks 3DAK!
    ALSA drivers Disabled! they make Buzz sound, and not really needed for CM7!
    only for LINUX ROMS (Ubuntu and others)

    *Added new kernel modules:

        Enable cleancache pseudo-RAM driver to cache clean pages
        Run-time PM core functionality
        ZRAM XVMALLOCATOR
        Compressed in-memory swap device (zram) + activation scripts for CM7
        Page cache compression support

    All Run auto! Except the ZRAM swap!
    All you need to know is HERE
    To activate the ZRAM in CM7
    At Kernel Install, choose from menu to install ZRAM SWAP

    Go to settings > CyanogenMod > Performance > Compcache RAM usage
    Use 26% for 110MB virtual ram swap (best choose)
    Or lower, or you can disable it any time.
    Reboot needed to apply the change.

    After reboot!
    You can check the swap load / stats
    Here is how to:
    Open terminal or connect by ADB SHELL

    [CODE]su -
    free
    #This will show you that you have swap! and 0 used!

    zram_stats

    #this will show you the usage + statistics in KB
    Also the compression rate
    Short info:
    Compression is with LZO algorithm. already in kernel [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG]
    ZRAM is RAM based SWAP, so it's take 357MB RAM and make them 700! or close to 720MB by compressing the data pages!
    CPU will work slightly more, when compressing RAM, but when done, it's will be free as was.
    This mod was lost for too long! time to activate it again! [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG]
    Also the old mod was called ramzswap! This project is closed, now it's new 2011 project in mainline! Now it's ZRAM!


    Thanks for all the donations! [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG]this is really help [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif[/IMG]09/11/11 Time:00:05

    *Added menu to kernel! now there is only one kernel for all! [IMG]file:///C:/Users/lastman/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG]
    Navigate in menu with volume down.
    Menu goes only forward. No back choose. (Just start over)

    You can choose:
    No-2way-REC / 2way-REC ability.
    CM7 + others OR sense ROM or MIUI
    MAG / CLK
    With new busybox 1.19.4 STABLE! / Or without! (Stay with yours form ROM)

    *Compressed kernel with LZMA compression! very small image.
    *I have added the smartass V2 it's working ok most of the time!
    *I have added and fixed the smartass governor!
    *Added kernel optimization with new tool-chain 2010 for best compatibility.
    *Added RiserFS partition support.
    *Added all commits from TYTUNG R13! (new audio driver as module, loaded with script that i have included.)


    The END
